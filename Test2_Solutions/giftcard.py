#  Description: The gift card is worth the amount of N dollars. 
#				Mark has to use it all at once without any exchange possible. 
#				He wants to maximize the value of the gift card by ordering many different types of dessert 
#				in the cafe without duplicates. Most importantly, he wants to spend exactly the amount on the 
#				gift card. Is this possible? What are the maximum different deserts he can order?

# Input: desert_list is a list which contents price of each desert (non-zero integers)
#		 N is the amount of the gift card
# Output: 6
